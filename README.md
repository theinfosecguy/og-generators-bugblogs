# BugBlogs OG Image Generator

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/new?template=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Frailwayapp%2Fog-generator)

Service that dynamically generates [Open Graph](https://ogp.me/) images for [BugBlogs](https://bugblogs.tech).

# How It Works?

Images are generated through the `/api/image` route. When you hit this route the following happens

- Query params are parsed
- Layout is looked up in list of layouts (Supports Blog Layout Only) using the `layoutName` query param
- `layout.getCSS` called with all query params
- `layout.Component` is rendered with all query params as `config` prop
- HTML page built, rendered with Puppeteer, and screenshot
- Screenshot returned with a long cache max age

# ðŸš€ How to setup?

The frontend is a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) site and the image generation happens in an API route.

```
# Start local development server
yarn dev

# Build for production
yarn build

# Start in production
yarn start
```
